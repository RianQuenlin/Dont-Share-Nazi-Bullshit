# Don't Share Nazi Bullshit!

This is simply a guide on NOT spreading extremist propaganda. Though it focuses on not sharing Nazi bullshit, it can (and should) be applied to any and all extremist content regardless of what ideology it aligns with, be it social, political, or religious.

## Don't post Nazi memes, comics, social media posts, or articles.

How often do you see people posting comics by Stonetoss, screenshots of Nazi hot takes on Twitter, or Nazi memes and saying how horrible it is? Too often, I wager. By sharing extremist propaganda in any form, you are spreading their message and ideology for them. To avoid spreading Nazi propaganda, you simply have to NOT spread it, this means...

- Don't link to it.
- Don't share it.
- Don't screenshot it.
- Don't save it.
- Don't mention it.
- Don't engage with it.
- Don't join communities that do.

Sharing Nazi content means you are platforming the ideology that attempted multiple genocides and started World War 2. There is no reason for you to share it. The only reason I regularly see Nazi bullshit is because people keep calling it out.

## Don't make excuses when told to not share Nazi bullshit.

I keep hearing the same excuses when I call someone out for spreading Nazi bullshit. Here are just some of the excuses I've heard from people knowingly spreading Nazi propaganda.

>"I'm calling it out as a bad thing!"

Everyone learns about the Holocaust and World War 2 in school, and there are annual reminders during Remembrance Day.

>"I'm posting it to mock it!"

The Holocaust claimed millions of lives, and the number of known victims continues to slowly but steadily grow as more evidence comes to light. World War 2 claimed even more lives. This is not something to be mocked, it is something to be feared. 

>"I'm posting a funny anti-Nazi edit!"

Extremists cannot be mocked, shamed, embarrassed, or humiliated in any way. The ones that can immediately turn violent and engage in terrorist acts against those who mocked them. Every time you post your anti-nazi edit, I guarantee you at least one person will look for the original source.

>"I'm drawing attention so people can report it!"

Would you draw attention to a revenge porn site by linking to it?

Would you draw attention to a drug dealer by posting his address on Facebook?

Would you draw attention to child pornography by telling people where to find it?

No you wouldn't. One **private** report to the mods will suffice. If it is not removed, escalate to the admin of the platform directly. If it's still not removed, you might be on a Nazi website.

If you feel that lives are in danger from extremist action, all law enforcement agencies have a tip line that can be used to inform them.

>"I want to discuss it!"

"Nazis are bad". Discussion over.

>"There's historical importance to this!"

You're not sharing historical media, you're sharing modern-day screed filled with hatred. Historians, curators, and teachers know how to display and discuss propaganda as a product of its time and context. You do not.

## By posting their propaganda, you're doing their job for them.

Most communities will ban Nazis on-sight. The ones that don't often have users dogpile and harass them until they do, or contact hosting providers, sponsors, and contributors to inform them that it's a Nazi platform. By posting their content, you are literally doing their job for them. Again, you cannot humilate or embarrass them. There has never been a recorded case of someone dying from injured feelings, and Nazis are no exception to this rule.

If you see someone post Nazi content, call them out on it and tell them to delete it. If they refuse to do so, report and block them for spreading Nazi propaganda.

## In conclusion.

There is no reason for the average person to post Nazi propaganda.

Don't share it, don't touch it, don't interact with it.

Report, block, ignore.
