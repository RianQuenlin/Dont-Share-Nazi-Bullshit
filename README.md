# Don't Share Nazi Bullshit!

This is simply a guide on *not* spreading extremist propaganda even for mockery. Though it focuses on not sharing Nazi bullshit, its principles can (and should) be applied to any and all extremist content regardless of what ideology it aligns with, be it social, political, or religious.

## Don't post Nazi memes, comics, social media posts, or articles.

How often do you see people posting comics by Stonetoss, screenshots of Nazi hot takes on Twitter, or Nazi memes and saying how horrible it is? Too often, I wager. By sharing extremist propaganda in any form, you are spreading their message and ideology for them. To avoid spreading Nazi bullshit, you simply have to NOT publicly spread it, this means...

- Don't link to it.
- Don't share it.
- Don't screenshot it.
- Don't save it.
- Don't mention it.
- Don't engage with it.
- Don't engage with the source.
- Don't join communities that do.
- Report and block it.

Sharing Nazi content means you are platforming the ideology that attempted multiple genocides and started World War 2. There is no reason for you to share it. The only reason I regularly see Nazi bullshit is because people keep calling it out.

## Don't make excuses when told to not share Nazi bullshit.

I keep hearing the same excuses when I call someone out for spreading Nazi bullshit. Here are some of the excuses I've heard from people knowingly spreading Nazi bullshit after I tell them to stop platforming Nazis.

>"I'm calling it out as a bad thing!"

Everyone learns about the Holocaust and World War 2 in school, and there are annual reminders during Remembrance Day. We already know it's a bad thing.

>"I'm posting it to mock it!"

The Holocaust claimed millions of lives, and the number of known victims continues to slowly but steadily grow as more evidence comes to light. World War 2 claimed even more lives. This is not something to be mocked, it is something to be feared. 

>"I'm posting a funny anti-Nazi edit!"

Extremists cannot be mocked, shamed, embarrassed, or humiliated in any way. The ones that can immediately turn violent and engage in terrorist acts against those who mocked them. Every time you post your anti-nazi edit, I guarantee you at least one person will look for the original source.

>"I'm drawing attention so people can report it!"

You don't draw public attention to drug dealers, child pornography, or revenge porn sites. You report those to the authorities. One *private* report to the mods will suffice. If it is not removed, escalate to the admin of the platform directly. If it's still not removed, you just might be on a Nazi website.

If you feel that lives are in danger from extremist action, all law enforcement agencies have a tip line that can be used to inform them.

>"I want to discuss it!"

"Nazis are bad". Discussion over.

>"I'm correcting misinformation!"

You still shared the misinformation.

>"There's historical importance to this!"

You're not sharing historical media, you're sharing modern-day screed filled with hatred. Historians, curators, and teachers know how to display and discuss propaganda as a product of its time and context. You do not.

## Nazi comics are absurd and exploitable for a reason.

A single throwaway line from a TV show can become a meme. A comic that can be easily edited can also become a meme. Nazi comics are sometime very exploitable for meme purposes. Yes, you wiped off the watermark, but no amount of edits, censorship, or distortion will result in legibility and inability to reverse image search.

Some communities are devoted to edits and mockery of Nazi bullshit. The end result of these communities is Nazi bullshit regularly hitting the popular feeds. Even if you were to block every single person even slightly to the right of Marx on any given site, it would barely put a dent in how often you see it.

Nazis don't get angry at their comics being twisted into the opposite message, they celebrate it. By posting mocking edits of Nazi bullshit, you have still posted and advertised Nazi bullshit. By posting it, you fell right into their trap. They provoked the exact reaction they needed from you; to spread their message.

## By posting their propaganda, you're doing their job for them.

Most communities will ban Nazis on-sight. The ones that don't often have users dogpile and harass them until they leave, or contact hosting providers, sponsors, and contributors to inform them that it's a Nazi-friendly platform. By posting their content, you are literally doing their job for them. Again, you cannot humilate or embarrass them. There has never been a recorded case of someone dying from injured feelings, and Nazis are no exception to this rule.

If you see someone post Nazi content, call them out on it and tell them to delete it. If they refuse to do so, report and block them for spreading Nazi bullshit.

## Still posting it? In that case, how do I know that you're not actually a Nazi in disguise?

I don't, but I'm not taking chances.

Your profile could be completely faked, your opinions could be falsified, your avatar could be AI generated. The Nazis utilized staggering amounts of propaganda to turn people against their neighbors. They were masters of deceit and manipulation, even during the Nuremberg Trials Goring had to be isolated because of his silver tongue influencing the guards and other prisoners.

But you're mocking them, you're commenting on how wrong it is, how could you possibly be the bad guy?

Because at the end of the day, you posted Nazi bullshit in a space that rejects the ideology. If I strip away your commentary and mockery, what's left? Nazi bullshit. Your commentary and mockery is dressing on what is ultimately hate speech. There is a time and a place for education and commentary on propaganda, and your social media feed is not it.

## In short.

Sharing Nazi content means platforming Nazis.

There is no reason for the average person to post Nazi bullshit.

Don't share it, don't touch it, don't interact with it.

Report, block, ignore.
